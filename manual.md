**Tips calculator** 

First of all, when we open this app, we will see there are two input lines for us. The first one is the amount of our check (how much we spent), the second one is the size of the party (how many people). After putting the data in the lines, click the compute tip button right under the lines. Finally we will get the tips for 15%,20%,25% by one person and also the whole party.
